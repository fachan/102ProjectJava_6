Visualization: triggered by a click on any part of the world. Opens a "portal"
displaying a section of galaxy.

Effect: miners passing through portals become blue Galaxy Miners 
(MinerGalaxy.class). Although the galaxy is accessible to miners through the 
portals, intergalactic travel is not the quickest way to reach a destination, 
 as miners who pass through the galaxy incur the cost of transportation 
via portal (represented in the A* algorithm by an addition to the g_score of 
a portal node). Such travel also changes a man (miner). Having become a Galaxy 
Miner, the traveler is no longer motivated to obtain minerals for blacksmiths. 
Instead, he seeks the galaxy tiles that exist under certain ores (mines ores to 
determine if galaxy tiles appear). After finding a tile, the Galaxy Miner 
disappears into the portal (having completed his goal).

New Entity: wyverns (Wyvern.class) may appear in opened portals. If Galaxy 
Miners exist in the world, wyverns follow in hot pursuit and, if possible, 
destroy them. However, wyverns themselves can be destroyed if they leave a 
section of galaxy and attempt to re-enter (this would occur if the shortest 
path to a Galaxy Miner involved passing through a portal, for example).
